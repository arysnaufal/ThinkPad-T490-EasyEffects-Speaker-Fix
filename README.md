# ThinkPad-T490-EasyEffects-Speaker-Fix
The ultimate EasyEffects preset to transform the ThinkPad T490's notorious "tin-can" speakers into a warm, "MacBook"-style (maybe) audio experience. Tested on Fedora 43 with KDE Plasma (PipeWire). Eliminates harsh treble and nasal midrange via aggressive V-Cut EQ.
